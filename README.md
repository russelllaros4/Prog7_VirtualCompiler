# Prog7_VirtualCompiler
My virtual compiler project for CSE109 Systems Software. 
It has multiple facets of functionality. 
It will take in a test .sasm file (our virtual language file format) and either: 
1. print out the byte code representation along with the instructions 
2. print out the instruction label map
3. print the instruction arguments
4. will print  the bytecode of the .sasm program
